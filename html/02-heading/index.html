        In html, there are six levels of headings, starting from <h1> to <h6>
        The <h1> tag defines the most important heading, while <h6> defines the least important heading.
        The headings are usually displayed in a larger and bolder font than normal text.
        The more it goes down the levels, the smaller the font size becomes.
