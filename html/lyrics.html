            <b>Lyrics</b><br>
            My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
            Everyone looked worse in the light
            There are so many lines that I've crossed, unforgiven
            I'll tell you the truth, but never, "Goodbye"
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
            And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
            Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
            And so I became the butt of the joke
            I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
            Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke
            Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
            Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
            Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
            It's brighter now, now
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            (I can never look away)
            I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            (Things will never be the same)
            I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
            (Now I'm wide awake)
            And now I see daylight (daylight)
            I only see daylight (daylight)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            And I can still see it all (in my mind)
            All of you, all of me (intertwined)
            I once believed love would be (black and white)
            But it's golden (golden)
            And I can still see it all (in my head)
            Back and forth from New York (sneakin' in your bed)
            I once believed love would be (burnin' red)
            But it's golden
            Like daylight
            Like daylight
            Like daylight
            Daylight
            I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
            (I can never look away)
            And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
            (Things will never be the same)
            I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
            (Now I'm wide awake)
            And now I see daylight (I see daylight)
            I only see daylight (oh)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (ah)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (and I can still see it all)
            (Back and forth from New York)
            I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (I once believed love would be burnin' red) (ah)
            Like daylight
            It's golden
            Like daylight
            You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
            Just let it go
            Let it go
            "I wanna be defined by the things that I love
            Not the things I hate
            Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
            The things that haunt me in the middle of the night, I
            I just think that you are what you love"
