    <!-- Links in CSS -->
    <!-- 
    Links are one of the most important elements of any website. By default, browsers give them a standard blue
    color and an underline. But with CSS, you can style links to make them look more attractive and user-friendly.
    -->

    <!-- ******* States in Links ******* -->
    <!-- 
    Links can have different states, and CSS allows you to style each one separately:

    1. a:link → Styles a normal, unvisited link.
    2. a:visited → Styles a link that the user has already clicked.
    3. a:hover → Styles a link when the mouse pointer is placed over it.
    4. a:active → Styles a link when it is being clicked.    
    -->
