    <!-- In this section we will discuss more about the position in css -->
    <!-- 
        The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.
        values:
            1. static: The element is positioned according to the Normal Flow of the document.  The top, right, 
            bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. This is the default value.

            2. relative: The element is positioned relative to the normal flow of the document, and is affected by 
            the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
