        Here, we will learn about Combinator in css 
        Combinator: Combinators combine selectors to target elements based on their DOM relationships.
        There are vaious types of combinators in css, these are:
            1. Descendant Combinator: denote by space/ ` `
            2. Child Combinator: denote by `>`
            3. Adjacent Sibling Combinator: denote by `+`
            4. General Sibling Combinator: denote by `~`
    -->
    <!-- 
    * Descendant Combinator 
    * Denote by space/ ` `
    * Selects elements that are inside (at any level) another element.
    * Syntax: ancestor descendant
    -->
    <!--
    <div class="box">
        <p>I am Inside .box #1</p>
        <p>I am Inside .box #2</p>
    </div>
    <p>I am outside .box #3</p>
    -->
    
    <!-- 
    * Child Combinator
    * Denote by `>`
    * Selects elements that are direct children of another element.
    * Syntax: parent > child
    -->
    <ul>
        <li>Unordered Item</li>
        <li>
            Unordered Item
            <ol>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 
    * Adjacent Sibling Combinator 
    * Denote by `+`
    * Selects elements that are immediately followed by another element.
    * Syntax: element + element
    -->
    <h1>Main title</h1>
    <p>this comes right after the main title</p>
    <p>this does't comes right after the main title</p>

    <!-- 
    * General Sibling Combinator 
    * Denote by `~`
    * Selects elements that are preceded by another element.
    * Syntax: element ~ element
    -->
